# Til Valhalla - Norse-Themed Cascading Slot Game

Welcome to **Til Valhalla**, an epic cascading slot game inspired by Norse mythology! Spin the 3x5 grid to gather Glory, trigger special effects, battle in Valkyrie‚Äôs Trial, and prove your worth to reach Valhalla. This game features falling animations, cascading wins, and skill-based challenges, all wrapped in a rich Viking aesthetic.

## Overview

"Til Valhalla" is a web-based slot game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players spin a 3x5 grid of Norse symbols (represented by emojis for now, with plans for graphics), match symbols on paylines to win Glory, and experience cascading mechanics where winning symbols explode and new symbols fall until no more wins occur. The game includes bonuses (e.g., Loki‚Äôs Trickery, Freyr‚Äôs Bounty) and a skill-based mini-game (Valkyrie‚Äôs Trial) to test reflexes.

## Features
- **Cascading Wins**: Winning symbols explode, and new symbols fall until no more wins are possible.
- **Falling Animations**: Symbols drop from above with a bounce, creating a slot machine feel.
- **Norse Theme**: Inspired by Viking mythology, featuring symbols like Thor, Odin, Valkyrie, and more.
- **Special Effects**: Bonuses like Loki‚Äôs Trickery (random win modifiers), Freyr‚Äôs Bounty (extra spins), Mjolnir‚Äôs Free Spin, and Valkyrie‚Äôs Trial (skill-based challenge).
- **Paytable**: Detailed payouts and effects for each symbol, accessible via the welcome screen.
- **Welcome Screen**: Introduces the game and paytable on first load, with a "How to Play" option.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers, with simple styling for emojis.

## Installation

### Open in a Web Browser
- No server or build tools are required. Simply open `tilValhalla.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Ensure all files (`tilValhalla.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.

### Optional Graphics
- Currently, the game uses emojis. If you have graphics, place them in a `graphics/` subdirectory and update `script.js` and `styles.css` to reference them (see "Graphics Integration" below).

## Usage

### Launch the Game
- Open `tilValhalla.html` in a browser. The welcome screen will appear on first load, explaining the game and paytable.
- Click "Start Game" to begin, or "How to Play" to revisit the welcome screen.

### Gameplay
- Click "Spin ‚ö°" to spin the reels. Symbols fall, cascade on wins, and trigger bonuses or trials.
- Use "Reset üåÄ" to restart the game with zero Glory.
- During Valkyrie‚Äôs Trial, click weak points (‚ú®) to slay foes and attack points (üî•) to defend, earning bonus Glory.

### Winning
- Match 3+ symbols on paylines (horizontal, diagonal, zigzag) to win Glory.
- Wilds (Raven ü¶Ö, Serpent üåä) substitute for any symbol except Valkyrie.
- Special effects include Loki‚Äôs Trickery, Freyr‚Äôs Bounty, Mjolnir‚Äôs Free Spin, and Valkyrie‚Äôs Trial.

## Graphics Integration

Currently, "Til Valhalla" uses emojis for simplicity. To integrate graphics:

1. Place PNG files in `tilValhalla/graphics/` with names like `rune.png`, `axe.png`, etc. (see the "Graphics" section below for a full list).
2. Update `script.js` to map symbols to graphic paths (e.g., `symbolImages['Rune'] = '../graphics/rune.png'`).
3. Modify `styles.css` to use `background-image` and `background-size` for `.reel`, buttons, and Trial elements, resizing to 80x80px for symbols, 150x50px for buttons, etc.
